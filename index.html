        <h3>Breed History</h3>

    <p class="c3rd ">The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for
 centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as
 sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense
 of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of
 extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering.
 Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>
